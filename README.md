# Dashboards :bulb:
In this repo I will insert different dashboards created for doing my analysis.

The first one is: **Portfolio Analysis: VAR and ES for 4 assets**. ðŸ“ˆ
I have chosen 4 assets: TSLA, AAPL, XON and KO and thanks Dash I have set up a simple dashboard in which the inputs are confidence level, holding period and weights for each asset. The data are downloaded from 1st January 2020 to 29th August 2025.

It shows not only the returns as a table and the time series plot for each asset, but it allows to calculate the VAR and ES as risk metrics. :bomb:
